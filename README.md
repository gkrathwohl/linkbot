# linkbot
A link-aggregating chatbot.  

Made in Node.js with Microsoft Bot Builder: https://docs.botframework.com/en-us/node/builder/overview/

This is a demo application using the Microsoft Bot Framework to write a bot that can connect to FB Messenger. 

LinkBot is pretty quiet, unless it sees a link. Then it'll let you know that it found a url and add it to it's list of links.
